Pre-compiled binaries for various operating systems will be available on the [Releases](https://www.google.com/search?q=https://github.com/dajooo/cloudflare-cli/releases) page.

## Usage

### 1\. Login

First, authenticate with your Cloudflare account. The recommended method is using an API Token.

### 2\. General Commands

Once logged in, you can manage your Cloudflare resources.

```sh
# Verify your identity and token status
cf whoami

# List all your accounts
cf account list

# List all zones
cf zone list

# Create a new zone
cf zone create example.com

# Delete a zone (with a confirmation prompt)
cf zone delete example.com

cf dns list example.com --type A

# Create a new DNS record
cf dns create example.com www A 1.2.3.4 --proxied

## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration

The CLI can be configured via a configuration file or environment variables.

### Config File

Upon successful login, a configuration file is created at `~/.cloudflare-cli.yaml`. The API credentials within this file are encrypted.

You can override the settings in the config file using the following environment variables:

- `CF_API_TOKEN`: Your Cloudflare API Token.
- `CF_API_KEY`: Your Cloudflare Global API Key (legacy).
- `CF_API_EMAIL`: Your Cloudflare account email (used with the Global API Key).
